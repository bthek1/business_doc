However, typically, electricity expenses can range from 5% to 30% or even higher for some energy-intensive industries such as manufacturing or mining.\nFor many businesses, especially those in sectors like retail, hospitality, or office-based industries, electricity expenses might represent a smaller portion of their overall expenses, perhaps around 5% to 15%.",
